Vision Assist Real-Time Object Detection for Visually Impaired People
Skills Used: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, OpenCV, SSD, Pyttsx3.
This system assists visually impaired individuals by detecting objects in real time using Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and providing voice feedback for the detected objects. The front-end interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end was built with Flask. OpenCV was used for image processing, and Pyttsx3 handled the text-to-speech functionality for audio feedback.
